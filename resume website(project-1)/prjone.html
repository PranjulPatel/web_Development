            <td>I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, I’m a college student pursuing my undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Technology from computer science branch.
                I started learning to code when I was at the school, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a school education, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.
                Since then, I’ve worked on my skills and was eager to learn and gain knowledge.I have worked as a Data Science intern at Devtown.org and contributed on my live projects.
               I have also joined National Cadet Corps to Enhance my Leadership skills and to always keep myself motivated for work.
               I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, c language, C++, and Java but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
                I’m constantly looking for opportunities to meet new people, sharpen my skills, and humble myself before the brilliant professionals of this city—who never cease to amaze me.
